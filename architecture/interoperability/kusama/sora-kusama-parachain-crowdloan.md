## SORA Kusama Crowdloan Rewards

To reward contributors, **5000 XOR have been minted** and will be distributed as follows:

* **9,363,480 PSWAP**; these rewards will be vested
* **676,393 VAL**; these rewards are also vested
* **77,050** [**XSTUSD**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2021/11/23/the-rise-of-decentralized-money-on-polkadotnew-algorithmic-stablecoin-launches-on-sora/?sh=7499e10731bc); these rewards are vested as well
* **500 XOR** will be distributed proportionally to contributors, with full distribution occurring at the start of rewards vesting

The **PSWAP**, **VAL,** and **XSTUSD** tokens bought will be vested and subsequently distributed as rewards to crowdloan contributors, while **the remaining 500 XOR will be distributed unvested.** Total rewards distributed will depend on the amount raised and will be divided proportionally, based on contributions; a hard cap of 100,000 KSM is anticipated.

Vesting of rewards will be done linearly, every day, starting from the update of the SORA network that begins reward vesting, and ending at approximately the expiration time of the SORA Kusama parachain lease. Reward claiming will be available via the [**Rewards tab in Polkaswap.io**](https://polkaswap.io/#/rewards). You can also use your crowdloan contribution rewards as they are released to get even [more rewards on Polkaswap](https://medium.com/polkaswap/pswap-rules-everything-around-me-three-pathways-to-polkaswap-rewards-63842caf88c0), such as the strategic bonus **Liquidity provision, TBC,** and **Market Maker rewards**!

## FAQ

### What is a Parachain? Why is it useful for SORA?

This question has been answered in detail in a **Medium article** that you can find [here](https://medium.com/sora-xor/the-sora-network-kusama-parachain-auction-5a6fe3a5f35f).

### **How can I contribute through Polkadot.js?**

### How Can I Contribute Through Fearless Wallet?

Please follow [this tutorial](https://wiki.fearlesswallet.io/crowdloans/walkthrough) from the Fearless Wallet Wiki

### How can I support SORA in the parachain auctions?

SORA won the 24th Kusama parachain auction for the 25th lease (February 22nd, 2022 - Jan 31st, 2023) on the 6th of February, 2022. The details can be found [here](https://wiki.sora.org/sora-kusama-parachain-crowdloan).&#x20;

After the slot on the Kusama Network is secured, users can support the funding of the auctions in the following years by buying XOR with DOT and KSM from the token bonding curve. By doing so, you'll increase the reserves of the token bonding curve and they will be used to make a bid in the auctions. Furthermore, there is a special reward in PSWAP when buying with DOT and KSM, this reward is higher when there are fewer reserves, and will decrease as they accumulate. You can read the full article about the incentive program [here](https://medium.com/polkaswap/pswap-rewards-part-2-the-sora-token-bonding-curve-70fab4c3f1b8).

In the coming months, there are no more auctions planned. Shortly, KSM tokens will be available on Polkaswap and users can support future auctions using them to buy newly minted XOR from the [token bonding curve](https://wiki.sora.org/token-bonding-curve). By doing so, you'll increase the reserves of the token bonding curve, which will be used to place a bid in the auctions. Furthermore, there is a special reward in PSWAP when buying with DOT and KSM, this reward is higher when there are fewer reserves, and will decrease as they accumulate. You can read the full article about the incentive program&#x20;

### What is Bifrost SALP?

Bifrost SALP aims to provide parachain KSM/DOT voters with the vsKSM/vsDOT and vsBond derivatives assets. vsKSM/vsDOT can be traded in an AMM at any time during the period that KSM/DOT is used for parachain lock-in, and also for DeFi applications such as Liquidity Farming.
