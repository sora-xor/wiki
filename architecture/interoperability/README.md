# Interoperability

This architectural solution paves the way for interoperability between the entire Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems leveraging the latest cross-consensus messaging protocols:

{% embed url="https://polkadot.network/" %}
Polkadot network
{% endembed %}

{% embed url="https://kusama.network/" %}
Kusama network
{% endembed %}

A bridging pallet compatible for any Substrate based network is implemented within SORA. This framework will standardize a direct and secure interaction between Polkadot parachains implemented on top of Substrate and Polkaswap, and the SORA network.
