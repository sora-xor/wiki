# Tokenomics

**XOR (天):**

* Network utility token used for transaction fees (gas)&#x20;
* 50% of the fee is burnt the other 50% for validators&#x20;
* Elastic supply, managed by a [token bonding curve](https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-the-new-economic-order-3ec3f0327e5a)
* Enables holders of a certain amount to become a citizen and a member of the [SORA Parliament](https://medium.com/sora-xor/the-sora-parliament-af8184dae384)
* Used to add liquidity to pairs on [Polkaswap](https://polkaswap.io/)
* Used to stake to become a validator or to[ nominate validators](https://wiki.sora.org/guides/how-to-nominate-validators-stake-your-xor) on the SORA network
* More about [SORA tokenomics](https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-the-new-economic-order-3ec3f0327e5a)

**XOR** token supply

* The XOR supply was 350,000 XOR until April 2021, when the SORA v2 network launched
* The XOR supply is elastically managed by a [token bonding curve](https://wiki.sora.org/token-bonding-curve) smart contract with buy and sell price functions. This means that as the token supply increases, the price also increases, and vice versa. The price is regulated by the bonding curve, so no extreme fluctuations in the price will be exhibited, but rather a smooth growth or decline

**XOR** distribution

* Fair distribution. 350,000 XOR were just put on Uniswap and then people bought over time. XOR distribution can be tracked on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x40FD72257597aA14C7231A7B1aaa29Fce868F677#balances) and on [Sorascan](https://sorascan.com/sora-mainnet/account)

**Top holders:**

When looking at the top holders on [Subscan](https://sora.subscan.io/account), several of those addresses are technical accounts supporting the whole network. Here is a table with the technical accounts holding XOR:

Additional addresses have been added corresponding to Polkaswap reward accounts. This list will be receiving ongoing updates to ensure accuracy.

**VAL (≚**):

* Used to reward validators on the SORA Network
* [Decreasing supply](https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-validator-rewards-419320e22df8) over time, with tokens burned at every SORA v2 network transaction
* Elastic rewards to validators and stake nominators are given in VAL, as a percentage of the daily burned VAL
* Holders receive a part of the XOR created by the token bonding curve to provide liquidity on Polkaswap. VAL holders can group together into DAOs to pool their liquidity and vote to provide liquidity to trading pairs on Polkaswap and receive PSWAP tokens as a reward

**VAL** token supply

* 100 million initial total supply and decreasing [with tokens burned](https://medium.com/@sora.xor/sora-validator-rewards-419320e22df8) (current supply [here](https://sora-qty.info))
* VAL is a free-floating token where the price is decided by the market
* Current VAL circulating supply can be checked [here](https://mof.sora.org/qty/val)

**VAL** token was distributed to 3 groups approximately equally, in 3 stages:

* Former v1 XOR holders (in Q4 2020)
* ERC-20 XOR holders as an airdrop (vested over time)
* An investment vehicle for the SORA ecosystem

**XST**&#x20;

* SORA (XOR) Synthetics tokens are algorithmic stable assets pegged to the value of fiat
* The XST token is burnt to mint the algorithmic stable assets corresponding to the value minted ($1 worth of XST = 1 XSTUSD)&#x20;
* The XST platform is currently under development and will be available soon.
* More [information on XST is available in this article](https://medium.com/sora-xor/xst-a-platform-for-synthetic-assets-on-sora-b45ca526d8d5)

**TBCD**

* Token Bonding Curve Dollar (TBCD) is a new proposed, algorithmic, non-synthetic stablecoin that has its value maintained by the SORA token bonding curve
* TBCD is created to be worth slightly less than $1 when XOR is far lower than the current price point on the token bonding curve, reducing sell pressure to XOR when the price of XOR is low
* TBCD will help to build up the reserves of the SORA token bonding curve, while also being used to fund the creation of new goods and services via on-chain referendum decided by all XOR token holders
* As a result of the implementation of this proposal, XST will no longer be minted to pay for project development
* More information [on TBCD is available in this article](https://medium.com/sora-xor/introducing-tbcd-ffdb115c9fb8)
