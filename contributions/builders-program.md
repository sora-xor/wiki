# Builders program

If you're interested in launching a project on the SORA network, you can apply for the **SORA Builders Program**. It branches out into two modalities, **New Project (Incubation)** and **Existing Project (Port).** New projects and ports can receive compensation in the form of XOR, as well as development support from the SORA community.
