# Referring a Friend

#### When you're part of the SORA network, you can earn rewards by referring friends. It's easy: just copy your unique link and share it with them. When your friends join using your link, you get rewards!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Remember, there are some fees involved for setting up this link, which the referrer covers by staking XOR tokens. When your friend joins, these staked XOR tokens cover the fees.

## Your Referrals

If your referral makes a transaction then youâ€™ll see the reward that you get. You donâ€™t need to claim this reward, as it will be added automatically to your XOR balance.\
