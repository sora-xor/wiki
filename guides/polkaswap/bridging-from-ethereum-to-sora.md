# Bridging from Ethereum to SORA

{% hint style="info" %}
:bulb: In order to use the bridge, **you will need a Metamask Ethereum wallet and a SORA account.** \
\
:exclamation: Make sure extensions for both accounts are installed in your browser ([**Metamask**](https://metamask.io/download/) for Ethereum and [**Fearless Wallet**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fearless-wallet/nhlnehondigmgckngjomcpcefcdplmgc) / [**Polkadot{.js}**](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) for SORA
{% endhint %}

## Getting started

1. Click on the **Connect account**\
   \
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image 40.png>)\

2. Next, **connect to the SORA Network** via your SORA wallet **by repeating the previous procedure.**
3. Click the **Choose token** button, select the token to bridge, and enter the token amount\

4. Then click the **Next** button and confirm your entry. **Please select only tokens with icons!**&#x20;
5. **C**lick **Confirm.** After that, the UI will sequentially ask you to **sign transactions with the Polkadot.js and Metamask browser extensions.**\

6. That's it! Please consider that **blockchain transactions do not happen immediately**, and it might take **some time for the transactions to process.**
7. Now go to the **Wallet** section and click on **Add asset**\
   \
   ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Group 174.png>)\

8. **Type the name of the asset** you've just bridged and then click on it, be sure you've selected the right token, looking at the logo and the [**ID Address**](https://wiki.sora.org/polkaswap/tokens-id-addresses)**.  Done!**

You can also move tokens from the **SORA Network to Ethereum by repeating this procedure in the opposite direction** (i.e. with SORA Network in the FROM position)
