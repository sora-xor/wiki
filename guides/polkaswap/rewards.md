# Rewards

### Let's dive into the exciting rewards available 👇

## 🌾 LP rewards

Powered by [**Demeter Farming**](http://polkaswap.io/#/explore/demeter/farming), you can pool various pairs and earn LP rewards. [**Available Pools.**](https://polkaswap.io/#/explore/pools/)\
\
Additionally, you can allocate your available liquidity to numerous pairs simultaneously. This opens up the opportunity to farm multiple pairs at the same time.

**\*Not financial advice. Always DYOR**

## 🧑‍🌾 Staking rewards

**Besides pooling, you can stake assets and earn rewards via single-sided liquidity provision.** New assets for staking are constantly added. [**Available assets for staking and their AP**](https://polkaswap.io/#/explore/demeter/staking)

## 💧LP fees

What’s more, as an LP, **you earn additional fees of 0.3%** of each swap on **Polkaswap.io**. The more users trade, the more liquidity LPs earn.

## 🌝 LP strategic bonus rewards

Polkaswap users can **earn extra $PSWAP** tokens for **providing liquidity to ANY pool on Polkaswap.io.**

**For XOR-VAL, XOR-PSWAP, XOR-XST, XOR-DAI, and XOR-ETH pools**, your rewards are doubled!

## 💫 Rewards for buying from the TBC

**Token Bonding Curve (TBC)** is a smart contract that automates token issuance, sale, and purchase based on mathematical functions.

Your $PSWAP rewards from the TBC **are exponentially calculated based on current reserves.**
