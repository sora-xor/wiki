# Swapping your Assets

{% hint style="info" %}
**Within the SORA network, XOR operates as a fundamental resource for seamless operations.** XOR is used to pay for transaction fees, therefore, **make sure to swap your freshly-bridged DAI (or any other asset) to XOR first.**
{% endhint %}

1. Go to the [**Swap**](https://polkaswap.io/#/swap) page
2. Then select desired assets for swapping (by clicking on the asset name)\

**There are a few parameters that should be clarified:**

* **Slippage tolerance** - The amounts that you see on the screen are calculated for the moment when you're making the swap. The exchange rate might change before you sign and send the transaction. Your transaction will be reverted if the price changes unfavourably by more than this percentage.
* **Liquidity provider fee** - This is a fee that will be distributed among accounts who have a share in the liquidity pool.
* **Network fee** - This is a fee for transaction in the network (_gas_).
