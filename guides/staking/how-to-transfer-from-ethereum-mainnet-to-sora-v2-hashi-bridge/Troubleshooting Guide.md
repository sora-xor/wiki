# HASHI Bridge Troubleshooting Guide

### Scenario 1)

**Your Ethereum transaction is pending/failed and the transaction hash does not appear in etherscan.**

In this case, it is very likely that when you bridged your tokens, an incorrect network was selected on Metamask (such as Binance Chain or Matic Network).

Double check the transaction hash in an explorer that supports those networks. &#x20;

If the transaction is not in an incorrect network, follow [this procedure to fix your transaction](https://www.notion.so/How-to-fix-HASHI-bridge-transactions-that-were-sent-not-to-the-Ethereum-Mainnet-d2dc4267849947eb83a748a6aefa97f1).&#x20;

### Scenario 2)

**You're bridging tokens from SORA Network to Ethereum, one of the two steps (SORA or Ethereum transaction) failed or it appears as pending, and you are unable to view your funds.**

Review the "History" option in Polkaswap's "Bridge" section, and click retry. Wait for approximately \~1 hour and check back to confirm if your funds are visible in your wallet.

If the problem persists, follow [this procedure to fix your transaction](https://www.notion.so/How-to-fix-HASHI-bridge-transactions-that-were-sent-not-to-the-Ethereum-Mainnet-d2dc4267849947eb83a748a6aefa97f1).&#x20;

### Additional Information

It is possible that the token you are looking for is has not been added to your Polkaswap account. Navigate to the "**Account"** section, then click "**Add Token**" and select the desired token.

When bridging tokens, sometimes the transaction appears as **"Failed"** but it has in fact succeded. Navigate to your [**Polkaswap Wallet**](https://polkaswap.io/#/wallet), refresh the page, navigate to the "**Account"** section, then click "**Add Token**" and select the desired token.
