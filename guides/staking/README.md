# Staking

In the SORA network, the Substrate-wide Nominated Proof of Stake, or NPoS is the consensus mechanism for block validations. Although a misnomer, staking can also refer to one-sided liquidity provision.&#x20;

To start staking, take a look at this guide on [how to run a SORA node](how-to-run-a-sora-mainnet-node.md), or alternatively, you can stake on the [Fearless Wallet app](https://fearlesswallet.io/) following [this tutorial](https://fearlesswallet.medium.com/sora-staking-is-now-available-in-fearless-wallet-d7251e268aff).&#x20;
