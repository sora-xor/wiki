# Check supply

**NOTE**: Please consider that you would see the **total supply** (this includes locked tokens and the circulating supply) of all tokens in the network and not only the **circulating** supply of the tokens.

The supply of XOR changes often because it is elastic, managed by the token bonding curve.

The supply of VAL and PSWAP might also change because they are burnt with every transaction.

**The current circulating supply for PSWAP is about 600M PSWAP.**

To check the number of tokens on the SORA Network, follow this procedure:

1\) Go to [SORA polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fws.sora2.soramitsu.co.jp#/rpc)&#x20;

Click on "Developer" and then "RPC calls"

2\) **Select **_**assets â†’ totalSupply(assetId)**_** fill in AssetID and press "Submit RPC call"**

Core assets ID:

XOR - 0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

VAL - 0x0200040000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

PSWAP - 0x0200050000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

ETH - 0x0200070000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

DAI - 0x0200060000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The results are shown for XOR:

353.0005 kXOR = 353 000.5 XOR (including XOR on Ethereum network)

### How to Read the Results

On the output, as you see in the picture above, you'll see the amount of the queried asset. Unfortunately, Polkadot.js only supports one asset for the network, that's why it shows XOR, but actually, it's the asset that you queried, either **PSWAP, VAL, ETH, or DAI.**

The letter before XOR shows the following:

k =  x 1000&#x20;

M _=_ x 1000000&#x20;

B = x 1000000000

For example, a request for the current PSWAP supply shows:

3.5105 BXOR =  3,510,500,000 PSWAP (600M is circulating and the rest is locked on the technical accounts)&#x20;

For example:&#x20;

* The current VAL supply:

70.5077 MXOR = 70,507,700 VAL (VAL on Ethereum is included)

* The current ETH supply:

1.7188 kXOR = 1718.8 ETH (ETH on the SORA Network)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-04-29 at 14.22.34.png>)

* The current DAI supply:

1.1827 MXOR = 1,182,700 DAI (DAI on the SORA Network)
